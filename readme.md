## Introduction

**Skill-Scape** is a project designed to break the traditional barriers of academic-focused education and guide students in exploring and developing skills beyond academics. The project categorizes opportunities by age groups (e.g., 14-18 years) and provides actionable guidance on skill development, competitions, scholarships, and earning potential. The goal is to empower students to unlock their full potential by exploring non-academic talents and achieving recognition at state, national, and international levels.

---

## Problem Statement

Many students rely solely on academics without exploring other talents or opportunities. There is limited guidance for students to identify their strengths and achieve recognition. Additionally, there is a lack of awareness about competitions, scholarships, and earning paths at a young age. For example, competitions like chess, spelling bees, and robotics are conducted at international levels, but many students are unaware of them due to being confined to schoolwork.

## Aim and Objectives

### Aim:-
To make students aware of opportunities available at their current stage and guide them in exploring skills beyond academics.

### Objectives:-
- Provide age-appropriate skill opportunities.
- Create a resource hub for competitions, scholarships, and earning potential.
- Foster non-academic growth and development.
